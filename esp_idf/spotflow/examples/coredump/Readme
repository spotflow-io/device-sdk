# Coredump example

In this example we are sending the coredump of the ESP32 to cloud.

## Configurations

In this you can set using
```bash
idf.py menuconfig
```
- Set Spotflow -> Coredump -> Enabled
- Set the Coredump Chunk size in menuconfig or by modifying the following Kconfig **CONFIG_SPOTFLOW_COREDUMPS_CHUNK_SIZE**. By default it is 2048 but you can increase or decrease it depending on your available memory.
- Similarly for queue reading and sending the value can be increased.

## Instructions for running the example.
- In your terminal run
```bash
idf.py create-project-from-example "spotflow/device_sdk:coredump"
```
- It will create a new project. Open the project folder and run

```bash
idf.py menuconfig
```
- In this fo into **Example Configuration** and add your wifi ssid and password.
- Then Go back into Main Menu and go into **Spotflow**, and add your device ID and Ingest ID from Spotflow Cloud.

Now Flash the code to your controller and after a few seconds push the boot button on the dev kit for it to crash.
